# tryfinally.dev

The complete source for [tryfinally.dev](https://tryfinally.dev/).

* The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses Jekyll. 
* To create/edit posts it's enough to push your markdown and GitHub will update the page automatically. 
* For non-content changes the website relies on some assets (html/js/css/webp) that might need to be rebuild locally using the `yarn build` script (requires Yarn Classic, tested on Windows but should *probably* run anywhere).
* You can develop locally by installing Ruby and Jekyll and running `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts`.
