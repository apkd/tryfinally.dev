Here's a useful trick for when you're way too deep in the Burst rabbit hole.

* chapter 1
* chapter 2
* chapter 3
{:toc}

Unless you have the luxury of taking the time to (re)write your entire project with the Job System and Burst in mind, you might end up stuck in a Burst context, but needing to call a managed method.

**Yes, you're reading correctly. I'm talking about calling Mono code from Burst, not the other way around.**

Maybe you have some managed code that you can't easily rewrite for some reason.
Maybe it's part of a plugin that you'd rather not touch, or stuck in some cursed `.dll`.
Or it could be a Unity function that doesn't support Burst at all.

Thankfully, a lot of the `UnityEngine.Physics`{:.language-cs .highlight} API methods work with Burst out-of-the-box.
Unfortunately, there's a few exceptions that require workarounds.
In the example below, we'll use `Physics.ComputePenetration`{:.language-cs .highlight} which is extremely useful when working with PhysX colliders.

The method signature looks like this:

```cs
public static bool ComputePenetration(
    Collider colliderA, // ono a collider
    Vector3 positionA,
    Quaternion rotationA,
    Collider colliderB, // onooo another one
    Vector3 positionB,
    Quaternion rotationB,
    out Vector3 direction,
    out float distance
);
```

As you can see, it takes managed colliders as arguments, so it definitely won't work directly with Burst.
We can, however, create a function pointer to a wrapper method, and use a workaround for passing the collider arguments.
It's kinda like the opposite of [Burst-compiled function pointers](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.7/manual/docs/AdvancedUsages.html#function-pointers).

> Note that we'll only be able to get this example to work with Burst-compiled functions, not the Job System.[^0]
> Jobs are limited to using only thread-safe Unity APIs, of which there's very few.

# Referencing `UnityEngine.Object`{:.language-cs .highlight}s in a Burst context

Unfortunately, there is no way to use Unity objects[^1] with Burst directly.
As a workaround, I suggest using InstanceIDs. These are non-deterministic, so definitely don't store them anywhere, but they're sufficient for
indirectly identifying a specific object (of any type inheriting from `UnityEngine.Object`{:.language-cs .highlight}) for the duration of its lifetime.

Getting an object's InstanceID is easy:

`int id = collider.GetInstanceID();`{:.language-cs .highlight .h5}

However, for some reason, there's no built-in way to get the object back based on its InstanceID in the *public* Unity API - instead, I'm using reflection to expose an internal `UnityEngine.Object`{:.language-cs .highlight} method. 
A more stable/responsive/responsible implementation could map objects to IDs using a dictionary, or something.

```cs
static class UnityEngineObjectUtility
{
    /// delegate based on an internal method in UnityEngine.Object: <see cref="UnityEngine.Object.FindObjectFromInstanceID"/>
    static readonly Func<int, UnityEngine.Object> findObjectFromInstanceId
        = (Func<int, UnityEngine.Object>)
        typeof(UnityEngine.Object)
            .GetMethod("FindObjectFromInstanceID", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Static)
            .CreateDelegate(typeof(Func<int, UnityEngine.Object>));

    /// <summary> Get object instance based on its instance ID. See also: <see cref="UnityEngine.Object.GetInstanceID"/> </summary>
    public static TObject FindObjectFromInstanceID<TObject>(int instanceId) where TObject : UnityEngine.Object
        => findObjectFromInstanceId.Invoke(instanceId) as TObject;
}
```

# Behold, boilerplate

```cs
sealed class ComputePenetrationBurstCompatible
{
    // the function pointer
    // this is where the pointer to the managed function is stored in a way accessible to burst.
    static readonly SharedStatic<FunctionPointer<ComputePenetrationDelegate>> SharedStaticFunctionPointer
        = SharedStatic<FunctionPointer<ComputePenetrationDelegate>>.GetOrCreate<ComputePenetrationBurstCompatible>();

    // delegate type of the function pointer
    // can't use System.Func/Action
    delegate void ComputePenetrationDelegate(

        out float distance
    );

    public static void ComputePenetration(

                ptr: Marshal.GetFunctionPointerForDelegate((ComputePenetrationDelegate) ComputePenetrationManagedImpl)
            );

    // the managed method we're invoking through the function pointer
    // you can use all managed C# features here
    [AOT.MonoPInvokeCallback(typeof(ComputePenetrationDelegate))]
    static void ComputePenetrationManagedImpl(

[^0]: Unfortunately (but probably for a good reason), jobs running on the main thread (eg. using `job.Run()`{:.language-cs .highlight}) are also forbidden from using Unity APIs, just like a worker thread would be.
[^1]: Anything that is a C# `class` can't be used with Burst (at least not without a workaround). Sadly, this includes all GameObjects, ScriptableObjects, components...
