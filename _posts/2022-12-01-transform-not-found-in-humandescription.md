When you're attaching a GameObject to a bone of an animated character using the Humanoid rig you might encounter the error (as of Unity 2021.3.2f1):

```log
Transform 'Attachment' not found in HumanDescription.
```
{:.h5}

The character `Animator`{{site.code.cs}} will stop working, so sweeping it under the rug is not an option. `Attachment` refers to the name of a game object attached to the character hierarchy. Enabling stack traces reveals that during scene rendering, the animator attempts to initialize itself and it fails while binding avatar bones to the transform hierarchy in the scene.

```cpp

Sadly, `AvatarBuilder::BuildAvatarConstantFromTransformHierarchy`{{site.code.cpp}} is native engine code, so we're not going to be able to take a look at the implementation.
However, I poked around and figured out that the issue is that Mecanim is picky about transform names.

This error message is particularly confusing because it refers to the Attachment bone, but in actuality the issue is with its children.

Take a look at this hierarchy:

![](/assets/img/posts/transform-not-found-humandescription-hierarchy-1.png){:style="width:20rem"}

I haven't figured out the exact rule (names need to be unique in transform path? unique at a given hierarchy level?), but it seems duplicate object names cause Mecanim to log errors with the attachment's root GameObject name.

To stop Mecanim from complaining (and get your animations to play), just make sure objects in the hierarchy have unique names.

As a quick workaround, you can use this script which renames GameObjects based on the `UnityEngine.Object`{{site.code.cs}} instance ID. This guarantees that objects are distinctly named (across a single editor session).

```csharp
[MenuItem("GameObject/" + nameof(RenameToInstanceID))]
static void RenameToInstanceID()
{
    foreach (var x in Selection.gameObjects)
    {
        x.name = $"GameObject {x.GetInstanceID()}";
        EditorUtility.SetDirty(x);
    }
}
```

![](/assets/img/posts/transform-not-found-humandescription-hierarchy-2.png){:style="width:20rem"}
